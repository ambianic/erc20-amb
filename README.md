# Ambianic Token of Appreciation

Ethereum ERC20 compliant smart contract for the AMB Community Token.

In its initial version AMB is a token of appreciation meant to recognize contributions to the projects in a public, permanent, measurable and non-repudiable way.

There is an active community discussion how to utilize AMB tokens in the future within the community network. We would like to create a Web 3 decentralized incentive system for all participants: maintainers, contributors, and end users. We would ideally find a way to construct a long lasting DAO that incentivizes fairly contributors of all kinds: coders, testers, marketers, podcasters, bloggers, voters, governers and other yet to be discovered roles adding true value to the ecosystem.

# Why does this Ambianic token exist?

In [this great a16z blog post](https://future.a16z.com/crypto-business-model/
), Jesse Waldem correctly points out what we have experienced first hand through previous Open Source projects.
> Open source code has enabled trillions of dollars to be generated by software companies that use it, but the communities that develop that code typically haven’t had a means to capture much of the value directly.
> That’s because there is a major difference between open source code libraries, which can be easily copied, and networks that form around running open source code as a service. An open source library is an empty blueprint. It’s dead code, until it’s run as an instance and is filled with data, users or both, forming a network or service.

Ambianic is an Open Source project. That's a deliberate choice aligned with our belief that transparency is crucial to build long lasting trust with contributors and end users.

However Ambianic is also a growing community of contributors and users who collaborate on ways to train useful AI models (such as person fall detection) without sharing any of their private home data. This is a very different type of community structure than a typical Web 2 organization that collects private data from its end users (sometimes without permission) into a central storage system to then mine it, anazyze and sell to third parties.

[Here is a great blog post](https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/) by Chris Dixon at a16z who summarizes why Web 3 matters.

Consumers are becoming alert to the risks of centralized Web 2 cloud systems collecting their private data. Governments around the world are also putting increasing pressure to Web 2 companies to stop collecting user private data. This shifts AI research and applications from centralized Web 2 infrastructure and tooling towards decentralized and privacy preserving Web 3 alternatives.

There are 3 pillars of the Ambianic ecosystem that Web 3 incentives will be crucial for:
- Local on-device AI inference and training on user owned devices with user private data
- Local AI labeling by end users on their private data
- Federated Learning on a network of participating private user devices.
