# erc20-amb

Ethereum ERC20 compliant smart contract for the AMB Community Token.

In its initial version AMB is a token of appreciation meant to recognize contributions to the projects in a public, permanent, measurable and non-repudiable way.

There is an active community discussion how to utilize AMB tokens in the future within the community network. We would like to create a Web 3 decentralized incentive system for all participants: maintainers, contributors, and end users. We would ideally find a way to construct a long lasting DAO that incentivizes fairly contributors of all kinds: coders, testers, marketers, podcasters, bloggers, voters, governers and other yet to be discovered roles adding true value to the ecosystem.

[Here is a great blog post](https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/) by Chris Dixon at a16z who summarizes well why Web 3 matters to us.
