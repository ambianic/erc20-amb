# erc20-amb
ERC20 smart contract for the AMB Community Token.

AMB is a utility token meant to recognize contributions to the Ambianic.ai project.

In its initial version it is only a token of appreciation without any value other than a public, measurable and non-repudiable way to recognize and record contributions.

There is an active community discussion how to utilize AMB tokens within the community network and create an incentive system for all participants: maintainers, contributors, and end users. We would ideally find a way to incentivize fairly contributors of all kinds: coders, testers, marketers, podcasters, bloggers, voters, governers and other yet to be discovered roles adding true value to the ecosystem.

If you would like to join our discussion, hop in our public [slack space](https://ambianicai.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-eosk4tv5-~GR3Sm7ccGbv1R7IEpk7OQ#/).
